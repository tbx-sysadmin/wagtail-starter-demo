# Wagtail Starter Kit - Django Project Template

This Django project template is designed for creating Wagtail builds quickly, intended for developers to bootstrap their Wagtail site development using `wagtail start --template=`. The template comes with pre-defined pages, blocks, functionalities, and fixtures to streamline the initial setup process.

## Todo

    - [ ] Resolve contrast issues with button component
    - [ ] Windows High-Contrast mode support
- [ ] Style other block types
- [ ] Style other field types for form page

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Set up a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.

    ```bash
    pyenv virtualenv 3.8 myproject
    pyenv activate myproject
    ```

2. **Install Wagtail**: Install the Wagtail CMS package using pip.

    ```bash
    pip install wagtail
    ```

3. **Initialize Project**: Use the Django `startproject` command to create a new project based on the Wagtail Starter Kit template.

    ```bash
    wagtail start myproject --template=<<path or git url>>
    ```

4. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Move into the newly created project directory.

    ```bash
    cd myproject
    ```

5. **Load Dummy Data**: Optionally load in some dummy data, to populate the site with some content.

    ```bash
    make load-data
    ```

6. **Start the Server**: Start the Django development server.

    ```bash
    make start
    ```

7. **Access the Site and Admin**: Once the server is running, you can view the site at `localhost:8000` and access the Wagtail admin interface at `localhost:8000/admin`. Log in with the default credentials provided by :

    - Username: admin
    - Password: password

### Deploying

Once you have your own copy of the template, you can extend and configure it however you like.

To get it deployed, follow the instructions below for your hosting provider of choice.

Don't see your preference here? Contributions are always welcome!

#### fly.io

Before you can deploy to [fly.io](https://fly.io/), you will need an account, as well as the `fly` CLI tool configured locally.

1. In the root directory of your project (the one with a `fly.toml` file), run `fly launch`
   1. When prompted about copying the existing `fly.toml` file to a new app, choose "Yes".
   2. When prompted about continuing the setup in the web UI, or tweak the generated settings, choose "No".
      1. The "Region" will be selected automatically. If you wish to change this, choose "Yes" instead, and modify the region in the browser.
2. Once the launch is successful, you'll need to [generate a secret key](https://realorangeone.github.io/django-secret-key-generator/)
   1. This can be done using `fly secrets set SECRET_KEY=<key>`, or through the web UI.
3. Finally (optional), load in the dummy data, to help get you started
   1. `fly ssh console -u wagtail -C "./manage.py load_initial_data"`

You can now visit your wagtail site at the URL provided by `fly`. We strongly recommend setting strong password for your user.

The database and user-uploaded media are stored in the attached volume. To save costs and improve efficiency, the app will automatically stop when not in use, but will automatically restart when the browser loads.

## Contributing

To customize this template for your specific project needs, follow these steps:

1. Create a new project using the provided instructions in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.
2. Make changes and customizations within the new project.
3. Once you've completed your modifications, backport them to the original template. You can do this manually or by replacing occurrences of `myproject` with `{{ project_name }}` including the name for the app folder with `project_name` (without double curly brackets). before transferring the updated code to the root repository.
4. Template files (.html), have to be modified using `templatetag openblock`. It may be easier to alter the root directory directly instead, however a general rule is to replace opening template tags with `templatetag openblock` and closing tags with `templatetag closeblock`, similary double curly braces will need to be replaced with `templatetag openvariable`.
5. Copy any static assets accross using `npm run build:prod` and `./manage.py collectstatic`.
6. Update fixtures using `make dump-data`


Happy coding with Wagtail! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to contribute or open an issue.
