## Getting Started

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Set up a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.

    ```bash
    pyenv virtualenv 3.8 myproject
    pyenv activate myproject
    ```

2. **Install Wagtail**: Install the Wagtail CMS package using pip.

    ```bash
    pip install wagtail
    ```

3. **Initialize Project**: Use the Django `startproject` command to create a new project based on the Wagtail Starter Kit template.

    ```bash
    wagtail start myproject --template=<<path or git url>>
    ```

4. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Move into the newly created project directory.

    ```bash
    cd myproject
    ```

5. **Load Dummy Data**: Optionally load in some dummy data, to populate the site with some content.

    ```bash
    make load-data
    ```

6. **Start the Server**: Start the Django development server.

    ```bash
    make start
    ```

7. **Access the Site and Admin**: Once the server is running, you can view the site at `localhost:8000` and access the Wagtail admin interface at `localhost:8000/admin`. Log in with the default credentials provided by :

    - Username: admin

## Contributing

To customize this template for your specific project needs, follow these steps:

1. Create a new project using the provided instructions in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.
2. Make changes and customizations within the new project.
3. Once you've completed your modifications, backport them to the original template. You can do this manually or by replacing occurrences of `myproject` with `{{ project_name }}` including the name for the app folder with `project_name` (without double curly brackets). before transferring the updated code to the root repository.
4. Template files (.html), have to be modified using `templatetag openblock`. It may be easier to alter the root directory directly instead, however a general rule is to replace opening template tags with `templatetag openblock` and closing tags with `templatetag closeblock`, similary double curly braces will need to be replaced with `templatetag openvariable`.
5. Copy any static assets accross using `npm run build:prod` and `./manage.py collectstatic`.
6. Update fixtures using `make dump-data`
